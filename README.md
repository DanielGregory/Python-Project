# Don't Get to 21 Game

## Description

This is a Python-based two-player game where the goal is to avoid reaching a total roll of 21 or greater. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die, and they can choose to either roll the die or pass on their turn. The game offers each player 3 passes, which allow them to skip a turn without rolling. However, passing too many times can result in the player being forced to roll. The first player to reach 21 or greater loses.

## Features

- Players can choose to either "roll" or "pass" each round.
- Each player has 3 passes that they can use to avoid rolling.
- The game ends when one player reaches 21 or greater, and the other player is declared the winner.
- The game displays total rolls and remaining passes for each player throughout the game.
